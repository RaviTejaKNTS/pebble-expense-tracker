# No BS Money Tracker

This is a super lightweight expense tracker built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The UI now uses a Material 3 inspired design with a sidebar containing Home, Categories and Settings options.
Click the floating "+" button in the bottom right corner to expand a colored pop-up form and add an expense without leaving the page. The pop-up includes a small close icon and you can press Esc to dismiss it.
All data is stored in your browser using `localStorage` so it works completely offline.

Open `index.html` in your browser to start using it. No build step or dependencies are required.
