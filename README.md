# No BS Money Tracker

This is a super lightweight expense tracker built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The UI now uses a Material 3 inspired design with a sidebar containing Home, Categories and Settings options.
Click the floating "+" button in the bottom right corner to expand a colored pop-up form and add an expense without leaving the page. The amount field is focused automatically for speedy entry and you can move through the form with the down arrow key. Tap the date button to smoothly expand an inline calendar. After choosing a day, the calendar collapses back into the button. Tap the category button to reveal a grid of chips for quick selection. Use the close icon or press Esc to dismiss the form.
All data is stored in your browser using `localStorage` so it works completely offline. You can also choose which currency symbol is used on the website from the Settings page with a searchable dropdown.

Open `index.html` in your browser to start using it. No build step or dependencies are required.
