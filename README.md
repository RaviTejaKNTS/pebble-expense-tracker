# No BS Money Tracker

This is a super lightweight expense tracker built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The UI now uses a Material 3 inspired design with a sidebar containing Home, Categories and Settings options.
Use the floating "+" button in the bottom right corner to quickly add an expense.
All data is stored in your browser using `localStorage` so it works completely offline.

Open `index.html` in your browser to start using it. No build step or dependencies are required.
